I am a software engineer, **programmer**. Especially I am developing server side web application and system. I usually use Java for coding. But I am falling in love with Golang and other languages, too. Because I like and enjoy learning new knowledge. So my roles in my team is a **pioneer**. I think we should accept risk for the better program. Here be **So Simple Theme**, the follow up to [**Minimal Mistakes**](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) --- by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com).
