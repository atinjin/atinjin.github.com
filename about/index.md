I am a software engineer, **programmer**. Especially I am developing server side web application and system. I usually use Java for coding. But I am falling in love with Golang and other languages, too. Because I like and enjoy learning new knowledge. So my roles in my team is a **pioneer**. I think we should accept risk for the better program. 

## My interest is all about:

* solving algorithm problems
* Computer languages : Java, Golang, Scala
* Framework : Spring, ORM, Shiro, Drools
* Continuous Integration : Jenkins, Gradle, Ant
* Testing : JUnit, JMeter, Grinder
* Distributed System : Spring Cloud
